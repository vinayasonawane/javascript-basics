    <h1>Challenge - 1</h1>
    <p>
      Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
      calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
      and height in meters).
    </p>
    <p>Your task is to write some code to help them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called massMark,
        heightMark, massJohn and heightJohn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in
        two variables called BMIMark and BMIJohn.
      </li>
      <li>Log the value of BMIMark and BMIJohn to the console.</li>
      <li>
        BONUS: Create a boolean variable markHigherBMI containing information
        about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Log it to the console too
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      TEST DATA 1: Marks weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92 kg and
      is 1.95 m tall.
