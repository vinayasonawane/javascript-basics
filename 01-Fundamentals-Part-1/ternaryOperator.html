    <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals - ternary Operator</h1>
    <p>
      The ternary operator allows us to write compact if/else statements in a
      single line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ternary operator is perfect for quick decisions, especially when we
      need to use the result as a value in another operation. However, it
      doesn't replace if/else for complex logic with multiple lines of code.

    <script>
      const age = 18;

      const printMsg = age >= 18 ? "You are eligible" : "You are not eligible";
      console.log(printMsg);
    </script>
