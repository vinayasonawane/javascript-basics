    <h1>values and variables</h1>
    <p>
      Values are the most fundamental unit of information in programming -
      pieces of data we want to use or store. We can store these values in
      variables to reuse them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript has three ways to declare variables: Let, Const, and Var
      <br />
      As a best practice, use const by default and only use let when you're sure
      the variable needs to change. This minimizes variable mutations and
      potential bugs. Avoid var completely as it has function scope rather than
      block scope (we'll learn more about this later).
      <br />
      You can actually create variables without any keyword, but this is
      terrible practice as it creates properties on the global object instead of
      properly scoped variables
    </p>
    <h2>JavaScript Variable Naming Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use <strong>camelCase</strong> (first word lowercase, subsequent words
        capitalized)
      </li>
      <li>
        Names can contain <code>letters</code>, <code>numbers</code>,
        <code>underscores (_)</code>, or <code>$</code> signs
      </li>
      <li>Names <strong>cannot start with a number</strong></li>
      <li>Names <strong>cannot use reserved JavaScript keywords</strong></li>
      <li>
        Variable names should be <strong>descriptive</strong> and meaningful
      </li>
    </ul>
    <script>
      // eg. of console log - values and variables
      console.log(48 + 28 - 9 + 6);

      let country = "India";
      let continent = "Asia";
      let population = 100000000;

      let isIsland = false;
      let language;

      // log to check number / string
      console.log(country);
      console.log(continent);
      console.log(population);
    </script>
